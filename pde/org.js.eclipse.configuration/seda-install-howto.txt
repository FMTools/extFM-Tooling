1. Checkout Seda Sources anonymously from SVN in workspace:
svn://svn.gna.org/svn/service-tech/trunk/Service-Tech-Java/seda
checkout all sub projects, except extensions not needed)

2. Checkout Pnapi Sources anonymously from SVN in workspace:
svn://svn.gna.org/svn/service-tech/trunk/Service-Tech-Java/pnapi

3. Install Textual Editing Framework from Update Site in Eclipse:
http://tef.berlios.de/updatesite

there could not be any longer the dependencies to the projects
 - org.eclipse.update.configurator
 - org.eclipse.update.core
