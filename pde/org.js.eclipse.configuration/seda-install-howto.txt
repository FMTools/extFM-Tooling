To use feature model to petri net transformation the following plugins are needed:

1. Checkout EMFText from http://emftext.org/update
2. Checkout M2M ATL SDK 3.1.1 from http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/m2m/updates/releases/
3. Checkout Petri Net API/Java, Petri net editors and SEDA Application from http://download.gna.org/service-tech/seda/updates/	

4. Build feature model from feature.genmodel (in org.js.model.feature)
5. Build feature EMFText from feature.cs (in org.js.model.feature)


OLD:
1. Checkout Seda Sources anonymously from SVN in workspace:
svn://svn.gna.org/svn/service-tech/trunk/Service-Tech-Java/seda
checkout all sub projects, except extensions not needed)

2. Checkout Pnapi Sources anonymously from SVN in workspace:
svn://svn.gna.org/svn/service-tech/trunk/Service-Tech-Java/pnapi
(url points to a plugin project)

3. Install Textual Editing Framework from Update Site in Eclipse:
http://tef.berlios.de/updatesite

Note: As in Eclipse Juno, the old update manager is removed, 
there could not be any longer the dependencies to the projects
 - org.eclipse.update.configurator
 - org.eclipse.update.core
 - org.eclipse.update.scheduler
 - org.eclipse.update.ui
resolved.

Therefore, the seda plugins hub.top.sed.rcp and org.st.seda.rcp report errors.
Workaround: Install the old bundles from the Eclipse 3.8 update site.
